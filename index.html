		<div class="desc">Tv Commercial for an Orchestra event by the Cyprus Childrens Museum made with Adobe: Photoshop for the logo, After Effects for the text animation, Animate for the animation and Premiere Pro to put the sounds and video together. The sounds were recorded on my phone because i didnt have a microphone and edited in Fl Studio. Originaly i made a stop motion animation of the text on a white board but i didnt like it so i made another one in after effects that i also didnt like. My boss wanted to include the footage i took of the orchestra practicing so this is the final advertisment.It is curently been aired on tv channel Rik

		<div class="desc"> This was a group project created during a university class, with the key limitation that no dialogue could be used in the final film. The objective was to tell a clear and engaging story using only visuals, movement, and editing.Challenging us to think more creatively about cinematic storytelling.

As a team, we wrote the script in advance, carefully planning out each shot and sequence to make the most of our limited time and resources. All of the footage was filmed on campus during class hours, and a large portion of the editing was completed collaboratively in class. I later refined the final cut at home to enhance pacing, visuals, and overall coherence.

The story centers on a student who suddenly remembers an assignment is due and races through campus, trying to pull everything together in time. It’s a lighthearted but relatable narrative that captures the everyday stress and chaos of student life.

By relying solely on visual storytelling, expressive movement, and timing, we aimed to create a short film that’s both humorous and universally understandable even without dialogue.

		<div class="desc">This university assignment challenged us to create a short film based on the prompt “One Last Chance.”This was supposed to be a two person project but just before filming began, my assigned partner fell ill from heat exposure and was unable to continue.He became dizzy, vomited inside the guard post, and ultimately had to rest in the car. Fortunately, a friend of mine was there so I quickly dressed him in uniform and directed him through the scenes while also performing as the second character myself.The result was a physically and emotionally demanding shoot—juggling direction, acting, and improvisation while dealing with an uncomfortable environment and very limited time.The film tells the story of two soldiers—one Greek-Cypriot and one Turkish-Cypriot engaged in a heated, cyclical argument across the Green Line, the UN buffer zone that divides Cyprus. This conflict, which has persisted for nearly 50 years, served as the emotional foundation of the narrative. Through this film, I aimed to reflect the ongoing tension, miscommunication, and entrenched hostility that have shaped both communities.
			<br/>
			Visually, the story transitions from black and white to color and back again. This choice was intentional, symbolizing brief moments of clarity and empathy that ultimately dissolve back into unresolved division. The rock-throwing sequence illustrates the pettiness and futility of hatred passed from generation to generation.<br/>
I chose to make this a silent film to emphasize the weight of the dialogue as text—forcing the viewer to read and engage with the words rather than passively hear them. My intention was to give these messages more gravity. I initially planned to experiment further with text-frame animations to reflect the passage of time, but due to the film’s brevity and time constraints during post-production, I had to simplify that vision.

		<p>I would like to sincerely thank the Willem de Kooning Academy (WDKA) for giving me a second chance to prove myself and fully explore my creative potential. This opportunity allowed me not only to grow as a storyteller and filmmaker, but also to reflect on the value of persistence, adaptability, and personal expression through visual media.</p>
